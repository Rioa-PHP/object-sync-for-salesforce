This file outlines the changes made to the plugin for the PHP integration.

All of the code that has been added is heavily commented.  Below is a summary
of the changes made.

classes\class-object-sync-sf-admin.php
When the plugin is testing the connection with Salesforce, the records being
pulled were changed to Campaign records from Contact records.

classes\class-object-sync-sf-salesforce-pull.php
Added get_unpublished_records function that checks for and removes records that
are part  of the integration that have been set to unpublish or whose status has
been set to 'Completed' or 'Canceled'.

classes\class-object-sync-sf-salesforce-push.php
Commented out code from 1135 to 1400 to prevent the plugin from attempting
to create new Salesforce records based on the manually created WP events.

classes\class-object-sync-sf-salesforce-select-query.php
Updated the query used to pull in records from Salesforce to make sure that
only records that are marked to be published get pulled in.

classes\class-object-sync-sf-wordpress.php
Updated the post_create function and the post_update function to use the
polylang plugin to set the language of an event.
